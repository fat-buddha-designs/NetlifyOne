  ## ACCESSIBILITY POLICY


  We’ve built this website to make it easier for all web users to contact 'Testing' or find out more about us.


  ‘Testing’ is committed to providing a website that is accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability.


  We are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of our website and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines.


  Our checkpoints are taken from the technical standard [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), published by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/).


  You can always zoom in or out if that works better for you.


  Press CTRL + PLUS SIGN (+) to zoom in.


  Press CTRL + HYPHEN (-) to zoom out.


  We have added ALT tags to all images, ALT Tags are invisible descriptions of images which are read aloud to blind users on a screen reader. Adding ALT text allows us to include images, but still provide the content in an alternative text-based format. If no ALT tags are provided, then a screen reader would only be able to say "IMAGE" or perhaps provide a file name.


  We also make use of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes where possible. ARIA is a set of special accessibility attributes which can be added to any markup but is especially suited to HTML. The role attribute defines what the general type of object is (such as an article, alert, or slider).


  The aria-label attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element. Use it in cases where a text label is not visible on the screen.


  The aria-hidden attribute is used to hide elements, such as icon names; that would otherwise make following a web page difficult for screen readers.


  We have included a Language Tag, this tag is designed to signal screen readers pronunciation engines which language to use.
