  This website is built with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), a static site
  generator and Jamstack framework based on Vue.js.


  It's hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which also handles the form submissions.


  Editing the content and adding Blog Posts is handled by [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/).


  Thursday is the main day for editing content on this wonderful website.


  Friday is the night we love to eat pizza and drink a glass of red! but only the one.
