Adding ALT text allows us to include images, but still provide the content in an alternative text-based format. If no ALT tags are provided, then a screen reader would only be able to say \"IMAGE\" or perhaps provide a file name.</p>\n<p>We also make use of Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes where possible. ARIA is a set of special accessibility attributes which can be added to any markup but is especially suited to HTML. The role attribute defines what the general type of object is (such as an article, alert, or slider).</p>\n<p>The aria-label attribute is used to define a string that labels the current element. Use it in cases where a text label is not visible on the screen.</p>\n<p>The aria-hidden attribute is used to hide elements, such as icon names; that would otherwise make following a web page difficult for screen readers.</p>\n<p>We have included a Language Tag, this tag is designed to signal screen readers pronunciation engines which language to use.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cookies-policy\"><a href=\"#cookies-policy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><a href=\"https://netlify-one.netlify.app/policies/#cookies-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a>COOKIES POLICY</h2>\n<p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit.</p>\n<p>When you view this website, we may store some information on your computer in the form of a cookie file (referred to here as “Cookies”), which will enable us to tailor the site to improve your browsing experience.</p>\n<p>We try to limit the number of cookies we use and only use those necessary to enable you to have a pleasurable browsing experience.</p>\n<p><strong>The Cookies we use on the Site can be described as follows:</strong></p>\n<p>CMSSESSID[unique id] - used to maintain continuity as you move between pages in the Site and expire when you close your web browser.</p>\n<p>We don't use any Third-Party Analytics.</p>\n<h2 id=\"privacy-policy\"><a href=\"#privacy-policy\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><a href=\"https://netlify-one.netlify.app/policies/#privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"></a>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>\n<p>This privacy policy forms part of the <a href=\"https://netlify-one.netlify.app/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">terms of use</a> that govern your use of the Fat Buddha Designs website.</p>\n<p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of the visitors to our website.
